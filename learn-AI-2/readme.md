
**General AI (Artificial General Intelligence)**

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines to perform tasks such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.

- **ML (Machine Learning)**: A subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed.

- **DL (Deep Learning)**: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze and learn from large amounts of data.

- **Neural Networks**: Computational models inspired by the human brain that consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) to process and learn from data.

- **General AI (Artificial General Intelligence)**: A theoretical form of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence across a wide range of tasks, similar to human cognitive abilities.
