Certainly! Here are simple one-line definitions for each term:

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines to perform tasks such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.

- **ML (Machine Learning)**: A subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed.

- **DL (Deep Learning)**: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze and learn from large amounts of data.

- **Neural Networks**: Computational models inspired by the human brain that consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) to process and learn from data.
