# Learn-AI
Here are concise definitions and examples for each term:

1. **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**: The simulation of human intelligence in machines.  
   *Example: Voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant.*

2. **ML (Machine Learning)**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.  
   *Example: Netflix's recommendation system based on viewing history.*

3. **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: A type of ML model trained on vast text corpora to generate and understand human language.  
   *Example: ChatGPT by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text responses.*

4. **Narrow AI**: AI designed for a specific task or application.  
   *Example: Spam filters in email services.*

5. **General AI**: Hypothetical AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence to any intellectual task, much like a human.  
   *Example: A fully autonomous robot capable of performing any human task (still theoretical).*

6. **Model**: A mathematical representation of a process that learns patterns from data.  
   *Example: A neural network predicting stock prices.*

7. **Train Data**: The dataset used to teach a model during the learning phase.  
   *Example: A dataset of images labeled as "cat" or "dog" for training an image classifier.*

8. **Test Data**: The dataset used to evaluate the model's performance after training.  
   *Example: A separate set of images used to assess the accuracy of a cat-dog classifier.*

9. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules allowing different software systems to communicate with each other.  
   *Example: Twitter API for accessing tweet data programmatically.*

10. **Algorithm**: A set of rules or steps for solving a problem or performing a computation.  
    *Example: The decision tree algorithm used for classification tasks.*

11. **Prompt Engineering**: The process of designing inputs that elicit desired outputs from language models.  
    *Example: Crafting the question "What are the benefits of exercise?" to get a detailed response.*

12. **Supervised Learning**: A type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data to predict outcomes.  
    *Example: Using a dataset of house prices (labeled) to predict prices of new houses.*

13. **Unsupervised Learning**: A type of ML where the model learns from unlabeled data to identify patterns or groupings.  
    *Example: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior without prior labels.*
